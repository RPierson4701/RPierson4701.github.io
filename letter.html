    <h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>
    <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
    
    <p class = "indent">Impressionism<br>Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It  has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</p>
    
    <p class = "indent">Abstract Expressionism<br>
    This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</p>
    
    <p class = "indent">Pop Art<br>A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</p>
